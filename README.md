  - We developed a new framework called panoptic pose esti-
mation, where models can be used across various environ-
ments in a **zero-shot** manner and if fine-tuned, they **require
10-100× less labeled data** than previous models. They also show increased performance compared to Im-
ageNet transfer learning, plus we demonstrate their ability
to be used in **down-stream tasks such as behavioral classifi-
cation**, suggesting they could become foundation
models for animal pose estimation
